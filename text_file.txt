Introducing SAM-CLI Version 0.18.0 


Telemetry for SAM CLI


SAM CLI is adding telemetry. In addition to existing feedback, telemetry allows us to better understand our customerâ€™s needs, common CLI scenarios and existing issues. The information collected will include generic usage metrics, system and environment information, and errors. These generic metrics will inform our product decisions and help us continue to deliver features and enhancements that improve the customer experience.
